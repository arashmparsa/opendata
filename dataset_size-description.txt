Data.gov Is a Metadata Catalog, Not a Data Warehouse
Data.gov and the data.gov CKAN API only contain Data.gov metadata about datasets. This metadata includes URLs and descriptions of datasets, but it does not include the actual data within each dataset.
So the ~370,000 datasets are links to data hosted across hundreds of agency servers.
Actual Federal Data Volumes (Major Agencies)

Rough Estimate for All of Data.gov
If you wanted to download everything linked from data.gov:

Conservative estimate: 100-200 petabytes
Realistic estimate: 200-500+ petabytes (including all satellite imagery, climate models, geospatial data)
Just NOAA + NASA alone: ~80+ petabytes of openly accessible data

That's 100,000 - 500,000 terabytes.


High-Value Categories for ML Training
Tier 1: Gold Standard (Large, Clean, Updated)
1. Census & Demographics (~5,000 datasets)

American Community Survey (ACS)
Decennial Census microdata
Population estimates by geography
Why valuable: Labeled, structured, massive scale, updated regularly
ML uses: Demographic prediction, geographic modeling, economic forecasting
Sensitivity concern: Profiling, redlining, discriminatory targeting

2. Weather & Climate (~20,000 datasets)

NOAA daily observations (billions of records)
Historical climate data (100+ years)
